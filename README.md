# Foundations 🧠

**Building a long-term technical brain.**  
This repository is my personal system for understanding the fundamentals behind **high-performance backend systems** and **AI-enhanced engineering**.  
It’s not for tutorials or finished projects — it’s the logic and ideas I want to internalize and keep using for years.

> Learn the principles, understand the systems, use AI wisely.

## 🧭 How This Repository Works

This repo is **organized around concepts, not projects**:

- **Foundations** = theory, principles, mental models  
- **Labs** = actual experiments and code ([ai-backend-labs](https://github.com/yunqiji-dev/ai-backend-labs))

Knowledge flows roughly like this:  
**Programming → CS Core → Systems → Data → Infrastructure**  
*AI acts as a cross-cutting layer, improving decisions and workflows across every level.*

Every concept should eventually **help me make better design choices** and **apply AI effectively** in labs or future projects.

## 🏛️ Modules (00–09)

Each module answers:  
> *“What do I need to understand to build reliable backend systems with AI support?”*

## 🎯 When a Module Feels “Complete”

A module is ready when:

- I can explain the concepts clearly without notes.  
- I understand trade-offs and can make informed architectural choices.  
- I can apply the ideas in at least one lab in `ai-backend-labs`.

## 🛠️ Guidelines

1. **Theory / Code Separation**: This repo is for ideas and mental models only; all code lives in `ai-backend-labs`.  
2. **Flat Structure**: Subfolders are one level deep for easy browsing.  
3. **Atomic Naming**: Files use `01-topic-name.md` for consistent sorting.  
4. **Commit Standard**: Commits follow `feat(scope):` or `docs(scope):`.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Learning is about **understanding**, not memorizing.  
Engineering is about **making better decisions**, not just writing code.  
AI is a **tool**, not a goal—use it to build better systems.

This repository helps me **remember the principles that matter**, even as tools and frameworks evolve.
