# Networking Devices

## Client
A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server

## Server
A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients

## Switch
- Switches have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to
- Switches provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN
- Switches do not provide connectivity between LANs / over the internet

## Router
- Routers have fewer network interfaces than switches
- Routers are used to provide connectivity between LANs
- Routers are therefore used to send data over the internet

## Firewall
- Firewalls monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules 
- Firewalls can be placed 'inside' the network , or 'outside' the network
- Firewalls are known as 'Next-Generation Firewalls' when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities

- **network firewalls** are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks 
- **host-based firewalls** are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine

# Interface and Cables

## Ethernet 
Ethernet is a collection of network protocols / standards 

## The Bits and Bytes
- 1kilobit (Kb) = 1,000 bits
- 1 megabit (Mb) = 1,000,000 bits
- 1 gigabit  (Gb) = 1,000,000,000 bits
- 1 terabit (Tb) = 1,000,000,000,000 bits

Speed is  measured in bits per second (Kbps, Mbps, Gbps, etc), not bytes per second

## Ethernet Standards
- Define in the IEEE 802.3 standards in 1983
- IEEE = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers


**Ethernet Standards** (Copper):

|  Speed   |     Common Name     |  IEEE   | Informal Name | Maximum Length |
| :------: | :-----------------: | :-----: | :-----------: | :------------: |
| 10 Mbps  |      Ethernet       | 802.3i  |   10BASE-T    |      100m      |
| 100 Mbps |    Fast Ethermet    | 802.3u  |   100BASE-T   |      100m      |
|  1 Gbps  |  Gigabit Ethernet   | 802.3ab |  1000BASE-T   |      100m      |
| 10 Gbps  | 10 Gigabit Ethernet | 802.3an |   10GBASE-T   |      100m      |

# UTP Cables
**UTP** = Unshielded Twisted Pair*

10BASE-T or 100BASE-T = 2 pairs (4 wires)
1000BASE-T or 10GBASE-T = 4 pairs (8 wires)

**Cable Type**
- Single-mode
- Multimode

Single-mode fiber is more expensive than multimode fiber
Single-mode fiber cables are longer than multimode cables
