## Networking Devices

### Client
A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server

### Server
A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients

### Switch
- Switches have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to 
- Switches provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN
- Switches do not provide connectivity between LANs / over the internet

### Router
- Routers have fewer network interfaces than switches
- Routers are used to provide connectivity between LANs
- Routers are therefore used to send data over the internet

### Firewall
- Firewalls monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules 
- Firewalls can be placed 'inside' the network , or 'outside' the network
- Firewalls are known as 'Next-Generation Firewalls' when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities

- **network firewalls** are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks 
- **host-based firewalls** are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine
