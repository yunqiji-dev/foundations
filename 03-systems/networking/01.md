# Networking Devices

## Client

A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server

## Server

A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients

## Switch

- Switches have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to
- Switches provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN
- Switches do not provide connectivity between LANs / over the internet

## Router

- Routers have fewer network interfaces than switches
- Routers are used to provide connectivity between LANs
- Routers are therefore used to send data over the internet

## Firewall

- Firewalls monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules 
- Firewalls can be placed 'inside' the network , or 'outside' the network
- Firewalls are known as 'Next-Generation Firewalls' when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities

- **network firewalls** are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks 
- **host-based firewalls** are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine

# Interface and Cables

## Ethernet 

Ethernet is a collection of network protocols / standards 

## The Bits and Bytes

- 1kilobit (Kb) = 1,000 bits
- 1 megabit (Mb) = 1,000,000 bits
- 1 gigabit  (Gb) = 1,000,000,000 bits
- 1 terabit (Tb) = 1,000,000,000,000 bits

Speed is  measured in bits per second (Kbps, Mbps, Gbps, etc), not bytes per second

## Ethernet Standards

- Define in the IEEE 802.3 standards in 1983
- IEEE = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers


**Ethernet Standards** (Copper):

|  Speed   |     Common Name     |  IEEE   | Informal Name | Maximum Length |
| :------: | :-----------------: | :-----: | :-----------: | :------------: |
| 10 Mbps  |      Ethernet       | 802.3i  |   10BASE-T    |      100m      |
| 100 Mbps |    Fast Ethermet    | 802.3u  |   100BASE-T   |      100m      |
|  1 Gbps  |  Gigabit Ethernet   | 802.3ab |  1000BASE-T   |      100m      |
| 10 Gbps  | 10 Gigabit Ethernet | 802.3an |   10GBASE-T   |      100m      |

# UTP Cables

**UTP** = Unshielded Twisted Pair*

10BASE-T or 100BASE-T = 2 pairs (4 wires)
1000BASE-T or 10GBASE-T = 4 pairs (8 wires)

## Fiber-Optic Connections

Tx ----------------------------- Rx
Rx ----------------------------- Tx

**Cable Type**
- Single-mode
- Multimode

Single-mode fiber is more expensive than multimode fiber
Single-mode fiber cables are longer than multimode cables

# TCP/IP

## Protocols and Standards

A **protocol** is a set of rules defining how data  should be communicated between devices over a network

A **standard** is an agreed-upon  specification that describes how a protocol or technology should work

### TCP/IP

**TCP** = Transmission Control Protocol
**IP** = Internet Protocol

## Layered Model

**Application** Layer (Telnet, FTP , TFTP)
- Protocols for communication between application processes; create and interpret the data
**I think:**
- **Application layer → what** (the content or type of data: web page, email, file, etc.)


**Transport** Layer (TCP, UDP)
- Provides end-to-end communication between application processes using port numbers  
**I think:**
- **Transport layer → who** (which process/application on the host is sending or receiving the data)


**Internet** Layer (IP, ICMP)
- Provides end-to-end communication between hosts across networks using IP addresses and routers
**I think:**
- **Internet layer → where** (which host or IP address the data is going to)


**Link** Layer (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
- Provides hop-to-hop delivery within a local network using MAC addresses and switches
**I think:**
- **Link layer → how** (how the data is transmitted to the next directly connected device on the same network)


**Physical** Layer
- Sends bits as electrical, or radio signals over the physical medium
**I think:**
- **Physical layer → the way** (the physical medium used: copper, fiber, wireless signals)


## Protocol data units
- The combination of data and a L4 header is called a **segment** or **datagram**
- The combination of segment or datagram and a L3 header is called a **packet**
- The combination of packet and a L2 header is called a **frame**

A **segment** or **datagram** is a Layer 4 PDU (L4PDU)
A **packet** is a Layer 3 PDU (L3PDU)
A **frame** is a Layer 2 PDU (L2PDU)

- The contents of each PDU (everything encapsulated by that layer's hear / trailer) are called the **payload**

A segment or datagram’s  payload is the application data
A packet’s payload is a segment or datagram
A frame’s payload is a packet

Each layer  communicates with the same layer on other devices (same-layer interaction)


## The OSI model

7 ---- Application
6 ---- Presentation    
5 ---- Session
4 ---- Transport
3 ---- Network
2 ---- Data Link
1 ---- Physical

## Ethernet Frame

Eth.header Packet Eth.trailer

**Eth.header:** Preamble(7) SFD(1) Destination(6) Source(6) Type(2)   
**Eth.trailer:** FCS(4)

- Preamble: Allows devices to synchronize their receiver clocks
- SFD: Start Frame Delimiter 
- MAC: Media Access Control

- Type: 2 byte (16-bits) field  
A value of 1500 or less in this field indicates the LENGTH of the encapsulated packet  
A value of 1536 or greater in this field indicates the TYPE of the encapsulated packet

- FCS: Frame Check Sequence
- CRC: Cyclic Redundancy Check

Ethernet frame payload minimum size: 46 bytes

## MAC Address

- 6-bytes
- "Burned-In Address"

- Dynamic MAC Address
Unknown unicasting --flooding
Known unicasting --forwarding

## ARP

**ARP** stand for "Address Resolution Protocol"

**ARP Request** is **broadcast** = sent to all hosts on the network

**ARP Reply** is **unicast** =sent only to one host (the host that sent the request)


 **ARP Address**
- Internet Address = IP address (Layer 3 address)
- Physical Address = MAC address (Layer 2 address)

A network utility that is used to test reachability

- ICMP Echo Request
- ICMP Echo Reply

### MAC Address Table 

- SW1#show mac address-table
