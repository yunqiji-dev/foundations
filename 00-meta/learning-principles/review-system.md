The **review-system** is the final stage of the **update-strategy**. It ensures that knowledge moves from a "Consolidated" file into long-term engineering intuition. This system is purpose-driven, not schedule-driven.

## 1. The Review Hierarchy (Module Sync)

In alignment with the **design-philosophy**, different modules require different review depths:

- **The Roots (01–04)**: Programming, CS Core, Systems, and Databases. These require **Priority Alpha** review—high-frequency active recall—as they form the foundation for all future backend work.
    
- **The Engine (05–07)**: Engineering and Cloud. Reviewed primarily through the "Dependency Trigger" when starting related projects in `ai-backend-labs`.
    
- **The Multiplier (08–09)**: Career and AI Integration. Reviewed during career milestones or when refactoring the AI integration patterns.
    

## 2. Trigger-Based Verification

Review is triggered by the practical needs of the repository, not a calendar:

- **The Confusion Trigger**: If I struggle to explain a concept while working in `Labs`, I must return to the **note-methods** (Active Recall) to re-verify the principle in _Foundations_.
    
- **The Refactor Trigger**: When a note moves from **Stage 1 (Input)** to **Stage 3 (Consolidation)**, the refactoring process itself serves as the primary review.
    
- **The 24h Refactor Rule**: As per the **update-strategy**, the first review must happen within 24 hours of the initial input to stabilize the logic.
    

## 3. The Socratic Audit (AI Teacher)

Consistent with the **design-philosophy** of using AI as a tutor, every review session must be an active dialogue:

- **The Stress Test**: Provide a Stage 3 note to the AI and say: _"I am the architect. Challenge my understanding of these mechanics and find the logical flaws."_
    
- **Scenario Synthesis**: Ask the AI to connect principles across modules: _"How does this memory management logic from 03-systems affect the indexing performance I'm recording in 04-databases?"_
    

## 4. Maintenance of Standards

Review is the "Gatekeeper" for the repository's physical and linguistic health:

- **H1-Filename Check**: Verify that all reviewed files still strictly follow the **folder-rules** (H1 Parity).
    
- **The English Filter**: A review is only complete if the note is entirely in clear technical English. If any Stage 1 "messy" thoughts remain, they must be refactored or deleted.

If you cannot explain the mechanics simply and in English, you do not own the knowledge yet.
