This document defines how I capture, process, and internalize knowledge. It is the practical bridge between **learning** and **engineering**.

## 1. The Growth-Oriented Structure

I explicitly allow my notes to evolve through three states, matching the **update-strategy**:

### Stage 1: Input (The Workspace)

- **Freedom**: At this stage, the note is a "buffer." I allow **English**, messy bullet points, and raw thoughts.
    
- **Action**: Just get the logic down. Don't let English or formatting slow down your primary comprehension.
    
- **Rule**: This is temporary. It’s the "Stage 1" from our lifecycle.
    

### Stage 2: Understanding (The AI Dialogue)

- **The Filter**: This is where I use **AI as a Socratic teacher**. I feed my Stage 1 notes to AI and ask it to challenge my logic.
    
- **Active Recall**: I turn my headers into questions. If I can't answer the question without looking at the bullet points, I don't "own" the knowledge yet.
    
- **Visualization**: If the logic is about data flow or systems, I must draw a simple ASCII map.
    

### Stage 3: Consolidation (The Foundation)

- **The Standard**: This is the "Product" for the **Foundations** repository.
    
- **English First**: To be consolidated, it **must** be refactored into clear, technical English. This forces a higher level of precision.
    
- **Tool-Agnostic**: It’s about the **"Why"** (Mechanics), not the "How" (Syntax). It must match the `# short-id` H1 parity rule.
    

## 2. The Engineering Principles

To keep the 01–09 modules focused on **Backend Core**:

- **Atomic Principle**: One file = One mental model. If it gets too long, split it.
    
- **Trade-off Analysis**: A note is incomplete without a "Trade-offs" section. Understanding why a design _fails_ is as important as why it _works_.
    
- **The 24h Refactor Rule**: Try to push a note from Stage 1 to Stage 2 within 24 hours while the logic is fresh.
    

## 3. Feedback Loop with Labs

- **Specs for Labs**: A Stage 3 note should be clear enough to act as a design spec for an experiment in `ai-backend-labs`.
    
- **Refinement from Failure**: When a project in `Labs` fails, I come back here to refactor the "Consolidated" note. Failure is just a signal that the principle needs more detail.

_My notes are the code for my brain. Refactor them until the logic is flawless._
