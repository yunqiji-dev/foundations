This document presents a comprehensive summary of the core strategies from "Learning How to Learn", focusing purely on methods and techniques applicable to mastering complex skills.

---

## 1. Chunking
- Break complex concepts into small, manageable chunks.
- Integrate chunks gradually into larger, automated structures.
- Practice:
  - Recall chunks from memory.
  - Reproduce through writing, coding, or diagramming.
  - Repetition builds deep understanding and long-term retention.

---

## 2. Focused & Diffuse Thinking
- **Focused Mode**: Deep concentration on a single task or concept.
- **Diffuse Mode**: Relaxed, broad thinking, allowing the brain to identify patterns and connections.
- Application:
  - 25 minutes focused work (Pomodoro)
  - 5 minutes diffuse break (walk, stretch, relax)
  - Sleep consolidates learning and strengthens neural connections.

---

## 3. Active Recall
- Strengthen memory by retrieving information rather than passive review.
- Techniques:
  - Summarize ideas from memory
  - Self-test or quiz
  - Explain concepts aloud or in writing
- Enhances chunk formation and long-term retention.

---

## 4. Spaced Repetition
- Review concepts at increasing intervals: Day1 → Day3 → Day7 → Day14.
- Focus on recalling core principles rather than re-reading all material.
- Converts short-term understanding into durable knowledge.

---

## 5. Interleaving
- Alternate between different topics or skills within a study session.
- Benefits:
  - Encourages flexible, adaptive thinking
  - Prevents superficial learning
- Implementation:
  - Switch between different skills or domains during study sessions.

---

## 6. Deliberate Practice
- Practice with clear goals, immediate feedback, and focus on areas for improvement.
- Examples:
  - Solve progressively challenging problems
  - Break complex tasks into smaller challenges
  - Incorporate feedback and adjust approach

---

## 7. Anti-Procrastination Techniques
- **Two-Minute Rule**: Begin any task for at least two minutes to overcome inertia.
- **Pomodoro Method**:
  - 25 minutes focused work
  - 5 minutes deliberate break
- Rewards:
  - Small and meaningful (water, stretch, brief walk)
  - Avoid overstimulation to maintain study rhythm.

---

## 8. Sleep & Consolidation
- Sleep is critical for processing and consolidating knowledge.
- Enables diffuse mode to integrate chunks into long-term memory.
- Short naps (20–30 minutes) enhance memory reinforcement.

---

## 9. Pomodoro Cycle Implementation
- 25 minutes: Focused work → Chunking + Active Recall + Deliberate Practice
- 5 minutes: Break → Diffuse Mode + micro-reward
- 3–10 cycles per day depending on workload
- Daily review: 5–10 minutes to reinforce previous sessions
- Weekly spaced repetition review: Day3 → Day7 → Day14

---

## 10. Core Principles
1. Learning should be active and output-driven.
2. Small chunks of knowledge should be combined and automated.
3. Alternate between focused work and relaxed reflection.
4. Spaced repetition consolidates memory.
5. Interleaving subjects promotes flexible understanding.
6. Practice deliberately with clear goals and feedback.
7. Prevent procrastination through small starts and meaningful rewards.
8. Sleep is integral to learning and consolidation.
