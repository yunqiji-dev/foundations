## 0. Why  This Exists

I entered university with gaps in both English and CS foundations.

In December, I finally built a study system (Obsidian + GitHub + structure repositories).  
At that moment, I realized I needed something simple — a small map I can follow when things still feel new and a bit chaotic.

This skill tree isn't for showing off.
It’s just here to keep me going in the right direction.

## 1.Foundations I Need to Stabilize (Current Priority)

These are the skills I want to make “comfortable and reliable” before touching anything advanced.

### 1.1 Programming Fundamentals

- Python basics
    
- Writing clear and readable code
    
- Simple problem-solving patterns
    
- Understanding errors and debugging step by step

### 1.2 Core CS Subjects (Aligned with my courses)

- Basic data structures (list, stack, queue)
    
- Intro to algorithmic thinking 
    
- Networking fundamentals
    
- Systems & computer concepts 
    
- SQL basics

### 1.3 Learning Infrastructure

- Using Obsidian in a consistent way
    
- Keeping folder structures clean
    
- Git & GitHub basics (commit → push → organize repos)
    
- A stable daily study routine

These are the "ground level" I'm building right now.

## 2. Mindset I’m Training (Engineer Thinking for a Student Stage)

I'm not an engineer yet — but I'm learning how they think:

- Start small, improve gradually (v0.1 → v0.2 →...)
    
- Keep things simple and clear
     
- Build rhythm before chasing speed
    
- Write things down instead of relying on memory
    
- Plan the structure first, then do the work

This section matters more to me than any advanced skill.

# 3. Skills for Later (Not Now)

I know I will explore these, but only after my foundations stabilize:

- Backend basics
    
- Python ecosystem (APIs, tools, libraries)
    
- Linux fundamentals
    
- DevOps basics
    
- More advanced CS topics

This part is only here for direction — not pressure.
