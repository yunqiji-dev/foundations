## 0. Why This Exists

I entered university with gaps in both English and CS foundations.

By December, I built a **study system** (Obsidian + GitHub + structured repositories) and realized I needed a **small, actionable map** to follow when things still feel new and a bit chaotic.

This skill tree isn’t for showing off.  
It’s a personal map to **stay on track, reflect, and make incremental progress**.

## 1. Foundations I Need to Stabilize (Current Priority)

These are the skills I want to make **comfortable and reliable** before moving to advanced topics.

### 1.1 Programming Fundamentals

- Python basics
    
- Writing **clear and readable code**
    
- Simple problem-solving patterns
    
- **Understanding errors** and debugging step by step
    
- Reading/writing files using dictionaries and structured formats
    
- Small project practice: e.g., **AutoGo Rentals System**, testing & iterating code
    
- Understanding code flow, role-based menus, and function modularity
    

### 1.2 Core CS Subjects (Aligned with Courses)

- Basic data structures: list, stack, queue, dict
    
- Intro to algorithmic thinking
    
- Computer organization & architecture
    
- Operating system basics (CPU, memory, scheduling)
    
- Networking fundamentals
    
- SQL basics
    
- Experimenting with mini-projects that combine multiple concepts
    

### 1.3 Learning Infrastructure

- Using **Obsidian** in a consistent way
    
- Keeping **folder structures clean** and organized
    
- Git & GitHub: commit → push → organize repos → undo mistakes
    
- Stable **daily study routine**
    
- Taking notes **with context, not just facts** (projects + questions)
    
- Reflecting on progress and adjusting plans

## 2. Mindset I’m Training (Engineer Thinking at Student Stage)

I’m not an engineer yet, but I’m learning how they think:

- **Start small, iterate gradually** (v0.1 → v0.2 → …)
    
- Keep things **simple and clear**
    
- Build **rhythm before speed**
    
- Write things down instead of relying on memory
    
- **Plan structure first**, then implement
    
- Ask questions carefully and **analyze problem wording precisely**
    
- Test systematically and learn from **failed experiments**
    

> My recent experience with testing AutoGo Rentals System reinforced: testing is meaningful only if I understand **what I’m testing, why, and how the system behaves**.

## 3. Skills for Later (Direction, Not Pressure)

After foundations are solid, I will explore:

- Backend basics (APIs, CRUD, simple servers)
    
- Python ecosystem (libraries, tools, automation)
    
- Linux fundamentals
    
- DevOps basics (CI/CD, deployment workflow)
    
- More advanced CS topics: algorithms, data structures, OS deeper concepts
    
- Practical project integration: combining CS + Python + real-world apps
    

> These are **targets, not deadlines** — direction over pressure.
