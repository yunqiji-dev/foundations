## 0. Overview

I started university in **October 2025**, but I only really began building in **December 2025**.  
This year is my foundation year — not flashy, not perfect, but deliberate.

My goal is simple: be a student who learns with the **structure and clarity of an engineer**, even while still catching up.

---

## 1. My Starting Point (December 2025)

- University English and new subjects felt overwhelming.  
- Many concepts in programming, networking, and systems were unfamiliar.  
- I needed a way to manage studying, projects, skill development, and long-term planning.

After these weeks of questioning, refining, and building, I found a structure that works for me.

This year is not about proving genius — it's about **building habits, clarity, and trajectory**.

---

## 2. My Motivation

I’m writing this plan because:

- I don’t want to drift through university without direction.  
- I want to close the gap between "what I know now" and "what I need to become".  
- I want my growth to be visible — to myself, to future interviews, and through my repositories.  
- I want to learn how strong engineers **plan, think, and execute**, and apply that mindset as a student.

## 3. Themes

### 3.1 Stability Over Speed

I've only just built my system, so the goal is not rushing ahead but stabilizing:

- study rhythm  
- repository structure  
- baseline technical skills  

---

### 3.2 Systems Thinking

- clear folders  
- clear plan  
- clean reasoning  

This helps me stay calm and prevents chaos.

---

### 3.3 Long-Term Orientation

Even though I only systemized my learning in December, I’m committed to thinking long-term.  
This plan doesn’t stop at the semester or the year — it supports my goals from age 19 to 35.  

This year is the foundation; the next decade is the trajectory.

---

## 4. Quarterly Focus

The quarterly structure helps me stay calm, avoid chaos, and measure progress — even if I start late.

### Q1–Q3 2025 (Pre-University)

- Not enrolled in university, intentionally left blank.  
- Marks the pre-university stage leading into **Q4 2025**.

### Q4 2025 — System Initialization (Present Stage)

Focus:

- set up all repositories and finalize folder structures  
- clean up learning workflow (Obsidian, GitHub, course notes)  
- catch up on core subjects  
- build baseline discipline and consistency  
- shift into a structured mindset that supports long-term growth  

This quarter is about **stability, not speed**.

---

## 5. Core Project Focus

This year’s learning is grounded in **one real project**.

### Auto Rentals System (Python)

- Menu-driven system simulating a real vehicle rental process  
- Role-based logic (Admin / Rental Officer / Customer)  
- File-based persistence (`.txt` files)  
- Structured menus and program flow  
- Incremental feature development  

This project is not just a submission — it’s my first controlled environment to **practice thinking like an engineer**.

---

## 6. How I Actually Write Code

### 6.1 Start from Confusion

- I often begin with “this doesn’t feel right” rather than a clear solution.  
- I question function order, file structure, naming — whether something is “correct” or just “works”.  
- Feeling slow and precise is better than fast and shallow.

### 6.2 Structure Before Features

- Execution order, readability, and logical grouping matter most.  
- I’m uncomfortable when `main()` feels messy or responsibilities are unclear.  
- I repeatedly reorder, rethink menus, and split logic for clarity.  

This discomfort is **the start of engineering judgment**.

### 6.3 Learn by Arguing With the Code (and With AI)

- Implement → feel off → ask why → reject → refine until it feels right  
- Question common solutions that don’t fit my mental model  
- Push explanations until I can restate them myself  

Slow, but builds **internal clarity**, not just answers.

---

## 7. How I Use AI

I do not use AI to:

- copy answers  
- skip thinking  
- generate final code blindly  

I use it as:

- a thinking mirror  
- a debugging partner  
- a forced explanation tool  

I only move forward when I understand and can explain the reasoning myself.

---

## 8. What This Year Is Really About

Not about:

- mastering Python  
- finishing perfect projects  
- being impressive  

It’s about:

- learning how **I** think  
- turning confusion into structure  
- developing an engineer’s sense of order, not just syntax  

Repositories may look simple.  
Pace may look slow.  
But the **trajectory is intentional**.

---

## 9. End-of-Year Success (2025)

Success means:

- I can design a small system without panic  
- My code has clear flow and reasoning  
- My GitHub shows **thinking**, not just results  
- I trust my process, even when behind  

If I achieve this, the foundation year has done its job.
