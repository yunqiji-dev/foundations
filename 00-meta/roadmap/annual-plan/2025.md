# 0. Overview

I started university in **October 2025**, but only truly began building in **December 2025**.
This year will be my foundation year — not flashy, not perfect, but deliberate.
My goal is simple: be a student who learns with structure and clarity of an engineer, even when I'm still catching up.

# 1. My Starting Point (December 2025)

- I have been overwhelmed by university English and new subjects.
- Many concepts in programming, networking, and systems felt unfamiliar.
- I needed a way to manage studying, projects, future development, and long-term planning.
- After these weeks of questioning, refining, and building, I found the structure that works for me.

This year is not about proving genius — it's about building habits, clarity, and trajectory.

# 2. My Motivation

I'm writing this plan because:
- I don't want to drift through university without direction.
- I want to close the gap between "what I know now" and "what I need to become".
- I want my growth to be visible — to myself, to future interviews, and to anyone looking at my repositories.
-  I want to learn how strong engineers plan, think, and execute  — and apply that mindset as a student.

# 3. Themes

## 3.1 Stability Over Speed

I've only just built my system, so the goal is not rushing ahead but stabilizing:
- Study rhythm 
- Repository structure
- Baseline technical skills

## 3.2 Systems Thinking 

- A clear folder 
- A clear plan 
- A clean reason

This helps me stay calm and prevents chaos.

## 3.3 Long-Term Orientation

Even though I only systemized my learning in December, I'm committed to thinking long-term.
My plan doesn't stop at the semester or the year  — I'm building a path that supports my goals from age 19 to 35, based on the personal roadmap I've developed.

This year is the foundation; the next decade is the trajectory.

# 4. Quarterly Focus 

The quarterly structure helps me stay calm, avoid chaos, and measure progress objectively— even if I start late.

## Q1-Q3 （Pre-University）

- I was not enrolled in university during Q1–Q3 of 2025, so these quarters remain intentionally blank. 
- They simply mark the pre-university stage of my timeline and lead into the point where my academic journey formally begins in **Q4 2025**.
## Q4 2025  — System Initialization (Present Stage)

- Set up all repositories and finalize folder structures.
- Clean up my learning workflow. (Obsidian, GitHub, course notes)
- Catch up on core subjects.
- Build baseline discipline and consistency.
- Shift into a structured mindset that supports long-term growth.

This quarter is about stability, not speed.
