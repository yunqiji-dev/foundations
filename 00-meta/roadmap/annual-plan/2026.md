## 0. Overview

2026 is a continuation year.

In 2025, I focused on building stability:  
learning how to structure my studies, organize repositories, and slow down confusion into clarity.

2026 is about **strengthening and extending that foundation**, not restarting or accelerating blindly.

The goal of this year is to move from “learning how to learn”  
to **learning how systems actually work and evolve**, while being aware of current technological demands.

---

## 1. My Starting Point (January 2026)

At the beginning of 2026:

- I am no longer overwhelmed by basic structure.
- I can complete small systems with clear flow and reasoning.
- I am aware when code works but feels poorly designed.
- I am still slow, but my direction is stable.

I am transitioning from asking:
> “Can I finish this?”

to asking:
> “Is this built in a reasonable way?”

This shift defines my current stage.

---

## 2. My Motivation

I’m writing this plan because:

- I don’t want to plateau after building initial stability.
- I want to deepen my understanding rather than widen topics randomly.
- I want my repositories to reflect thinking, not just assignments.
- I want my preparation to align with how the industry is actually evolving.

This year is about **making foundations usable**, and laying the groundwork for future growth.

## 3. Direction Adjustment

This repository was initially built with a clear goal:

**to become a backend engineer.**

Backend engineering emphasizes:

- system structure  
- data flow  
- execution order  
- responsibility separation  

These aspects matched how I naturally approached problems as a first-year student.  
Backend projects provided a controlled environment to learn:

- why systems are structured the way they are  
- how components interact  
- how complexity is managed through structure  

Over time, I realized that **backend alone is no longer sufficient**.

Modern backend systems increasingly involve:

- AI-assisted services  
- intelligent data pipelines  
- automation and decision logic  
- integration with model-based components  

As a result, my long-term orientation evolved into:

> **becoming a backend engineer who understands and works with AI systems.**

This adjustment extends, rather than replaces, foundational skills.

## 4. Priority Awareness: English as the First-Order Factor

At the freshman stage, I realized clearly that:

**English is the first-order factor in all technical growth.**

Not as a general language skill,  
but as a **technical foundation** that enables everything else.

English directly determines:

- understanding documentation  
- learning system-level concepts  
- accessing AI-related resources  
- explaining design decisions clearly  

Without sufficient English ability:

- technical learning slows down  
- understanding remains shallow  
- collaboration and communication are limited  

At this stage, **all other priorities are built on top of English proficiency**.  

It is deliberately placed first, above:

- backend fundamentals  
- system design  
- AI-awareness  

Because without English, deeper technical progress cannot compound effectively.

---

## 5. Year Focus

### 5.1 Technical Focus

- reinforce backend fundamentals  
- improve code organization and readability  
- practice explaining design choices  
- gradually learn how AI integrates with backend systems  

---

### 5.2 Learning Focus

- Operating Systems fundamentals  
- understanding how programs run, not just how they are written  
- linking theory back to practical experience  
- AI system awareness (integration patterns, not deep modeling yet)  

---

### 5.3 Communication Focus

- reading technical material in English  
- writing documentation in English  
- prioritizing clarity over fluency  

English remains the **foundation for all learning this year**.

---

## 6. How I Continue to Write Code

- start from uncertainty  
- implement carefully  
- question structure and order  
- refactor for clarity  

I move slowly, but with more intent.  
Refactoring is guided by reasoning.  
Discomfort is treated as a signal, not a failure.

---

## 7. What This Year Is Really About

This year is not about:

- mastering AI  
- building impressive projects  
- rushing toward specialization  

It is about:

- making my foundations reliable  
- aligning my direction with reality  
- preparing for future complexity  
- ensuring English proficiency underpins all technical growth  

---

## 8. End-of-Year Success (2026)

Success at the end of 2026 means:

- I can design and explain a medium-sized system calmly  
- My code reflects clear structure and intent  
- I understand how OS concepts relate to program behavior  
- My English no longer blocks technical learning  
- My GitHub shows continuity and growth  
- My orientation toward AI-aware backend development is actionable  

If these are achieved, 2026 has fulfilled its role.

> 2025 was about learning how to stand steadily.  
> 2026 is about learning how to move deliberately,  
> with English as the foundation, and awareness of both backend and AI integration.
