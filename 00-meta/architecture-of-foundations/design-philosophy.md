I built this *foundations* repository because I needed a way to study like an engineer, not just survive university courses.  
I started late, my English was shaky, and many CS topics felt overwhelming. But I realized something: feeling lost is normal — staying lost isn’t.  
I needed a system that keeps me steady even when I’m still catching up.

This repository is that system.

I designed 00–08 as layers that mirror how strong engineers think:  
clear boundaries, consistent structure, and reasoning that doesn’t collapse when things get complex.  
Courses teach topics, but this repository teaches me **how to organize, understand, and build**.

- **00-meta** sets my direction and mindset.  
- **01–08** turn every course, concept, habit, and practice into something I can track and grow.

Nothing here is for show.  
This is not a portfolio, and I’m not trying to look advanced.  
This space exists so I can learn slowly, cleanly, and without chaos — and so every month I can see myself becoming more capable than before.

I’m a first-year student, but I’m training the foundation of an engineer:  
structure, clarity, and long-term thinking.

This repository is where that training happens.
