This document defines how knowledge enters, evolves, and stabilizes inside the _Foundations_ repository. It is a system for internalizing principles, not just storing information.

## 1. Knowledge Lifecycle

Knowledge evolves through three deliberate stages:

1. **Input**: Raw notes derived from courses or books. Focused on exposure.
    
2. **Understanding**: Rewritten in my own words. Relationships and trade-offs become clearer.
    
3. **Consolidation**: Clean, tool-agnostic explanations. Directly useful for architectural reasoning and `Labs`.
    

## 2. Refactoring Strategy (00–09)

Refactoring is the core of this system. I maintain the 10-module integrity through:

- **Refactor over Append**: Prefer rewriting over appending. Replace old explanations when understanding changes.
    
- **Structural Precision**: Ensure concepts are moved to their correct modules (01–09) as understanding stabilizes, even if they were initially learned together.
    
- **Pruning**: Deletion is a normal part of learning. Delete notes that only served a temporary learning purpose.
    

## 3. AI & Language Guardrails

- **AI-Assisted Content**: AI is a tutor, not a source of truth. If I cannot explain a concept without AI, the note is not considered **Consolidated**.
    
- **English as the Standard**: English remains the first-order factor. Refactoring a note into English is the final step of the "Understanding" stage.
    

## 4. Review & Sync

- **Purpose-Driven Review**: Review happens naturally during ongoing learning or when preparing for `ai-backend-labs`.
    
- **Theory-Practice Loop**: Principles from _Foundations_ guide the `Labs`, while implementation feedback from `Labs` refines the _Foundations_.
