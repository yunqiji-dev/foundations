I built this _foundations_ repository because I needed to study like an engineer, not just survive university courses.

**Version 2.0** is a deliberate refactoring. I deleted the previous framework and rebuilt it into this 10-module architecture (00–09) to align with my long-term orientation: **becoming a backend engineer who masters the core and leverages AI as a cognitive multiplier.**

### 1. The Rebuilt Layers: Backend as the Core

I have redefined the 10 modules into three logical clusters that prioritize backend depth and strategic AI use:

- **00–02 (The Roots)**: Meta-cognition, language mastery (C/Python), and CS fundamentals. These are the sources of all technical reasoning.
    
- **03–07 (The Engine)**: Systems, Databases, Software/Data Engineering, and Cloud Infrastructure. This is the **Backend Core**—where performance, reliability, and scale are built.
    
- **08–09 (The Multiplier)**: Professional growth and AI-enhanced workflows. **AI is a tool, not the goal.** Module 09 is the extension layer where I transition from using AI as a "tutor" to integrating it as a "system component."
    

### 2. The Evolution of AI Roles

My philosophy distinguishes between the stages of my growth and how I interact with AI:

- **Learning Stage (The Tutor)**: AI functions as a "Socratic teacher" used to deconstruct complex backend principles across all foundational modules (01–08). It is a scaffolding used to build my internal logic and master English as a technical tool.
    
- **Engineering Stage (The Multiplier)**: AI becomes an integrated "engine" or "component" within my backend architecture. I master the core foundations first so that I remain the **architect** who directs the AI, ensuring the resulting systems are robust and well-reasoned.
    

### 3. Logic over Implementation

The fundamental rule remains: **Principles live here; experiments live in `ai-backend-labs`.** This separation of concerns ensures that my mental models remain clean, stable, and independent of temporary code implementation.

### 4. The Mindset

I am a first-year student training my brain for the long term. I use English as my primary technical tool to ensure I am learning at a global standard. I had the courage to refactor my entire system because a world-class engineer knows when the foundation needs to be stronger to support a more powerful future.
